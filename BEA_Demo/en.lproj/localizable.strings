"cyberfundsearch.Disclaimer.text.1"="Investment involves risks. The price of units may go down as well as up as the investments of a fund are subject to the market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investments. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. \n\nInvestment in emerging markets involves above-average investment risks, for instance, possible fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, political and economic uncertainties. Investment returns not denominated in HKD or USD are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. Transactions in derivative instruments may be used to meet the investment objectives of some funds and may therefore lead to higher volatility in net asset value and may involve a greater degree of risk than is the case with conventional securities. It is possible that investors may lose some or the entire amount they have invested in the funds. \n\nBefore making any investment, investors should refer to all relevant investment fund offering documents, including the Explanatory Memorandum, for detailed information including the risk factors. Printed copies of the fund prospectuses are also available at any of our branches for reference. \n\nThe investment decision is yours but you should not invest in the investment funds unless the intermediary who sells it to you has explained to you that the investment funds are suitable for you having regard to your financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. \n\nInvestors should not make an investment decision based solely on this web page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n";
